# ScrimbaOldagram

This is the fifth solo project done through Scrimba that reinforces HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is a parody of the famous Instagram and by pressing the down arrow at the bottom, you can see rotating post. The like button also works and it increases the number of likes. This project reinforces changing values and images in Javascript through an object.
